# Mixin D3

Although the component-based frameworks, e.g. vue, react, angular, are used everywhere, [D3js](https://d3js.org/) is still the industry standard for data visualization. Lots seem not to be big fans of how D3 handles updating DOM, especially at the moment that [You-Don't-Need-jQuery](https://github.com/nefe/You-Dont-Need-jQuery). Then some things become interesting and annoying, libraries go back and forth between abstraction and flexibility, from the most talented DSL to low-level vanilla js, many awesome projects appear every year, as well as the totally awesome browsers.

Modern browsers come with a suite of different technologies called [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), the heavily used development way in our vanilla js projects, with loads of dependent of D3, I write the [mixin_d3.js](/lib/mixin_d3.js), to approach a little bit of more friendly data-driven programming, which just works as below.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> [_Edit in here_](https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-c6aqfb?file=index.js), or if you [_prefer typescript_](https://codesandbox.io/s/long-violet-7d9ehm?file=/src/index.ts).

<div class="repeat-circle">
  <img src="media/repeat-circle.gif" alt="repeat circle">

```js
document.body.innerHTML = '<my-app viewBox="0,0,960,500"></my-app>';
const myApp = document.querySelector("my-app");
myApp.data = [
  {
    tag: "circle",
    attrs: {
      class: "component",
      fill: "steelblue",
      r: 20,
      cx: 40,
      cy: 250,
    },
    transitions: [
      {
        duration: 2000,
        attrs: { cx: 920 },
      },
      {
        duration: 2000,
        attrs: { cx: 40 },
        events: {
          end() {
            // repeat the circle
            myApp.data[0].transitions = myApp.data[0].transitions;
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

It seems yet another JSON-style coding library? ðŸ˜’, um...Yes, a sort of. If you're interested, don't be hesitated to run/test the code, just `yarn && yarn tw` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see more examples, such as a very simple [bar chart](/__tests__/lib/bar_chart.js), [Tic Tac Toe](/__tests__/lib/tic_tac_toe.js) against [react tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#completing-the-game).

## Hello World

The smallest mixin_d3 example looks like this:

```js
<script type="module">
  window.customElements.define(
    "my-app",
    class extends MixinD3 {
      connectedCallback() {
        super.connectedCallback();
        this.data = [{ tag: "h1", text: "Hello, World" }];
      }
    }
  );
</script>

<my-app></my-app>
```

It displays a heading saying "Hello, world!" on the page.

## Rendering Children

Children are the smallest building blocks of mixin_d3 Web Components.

A child describes what you want to see on the screen:

```js
const children = [{ tag: "h1", text: "Hello, world" }];
```

Unlike browser DOM elements, mixin_d3 children are JSON-like objects, and are cheap to create. mixin_d3 takes care of updating the DOM to match the children.

### Rendering children into the DOM

Let's say there is a `<my-app>` somewhere you have created from [Hello World](#hello-world) section in your HTML file:

```html
<my-app>
  <h1>Hello, World</h1>
</my-app>
```

By default, a custom element itself or its attached `shadowRoot` is the "root" DOM node where mixin_d3 will render children at. In the case of `<my-app>` the `root` is itself.

To render mixin_d3 children, simply assigns the array to `myApp.data`:

```js
document.querySelector("my-app").data = [{ tag: "h1", text: "Hello, world" }];
```

**Toggle on the Console panel in [Hello World](https://codepen.io/vegertar/pen/MWQRybP) example and paste the above code.**

It displays "Hello, world" on the page.

### Updating the Rendered Element

mixin_d3 children are [changelog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changelog). Once you create a child datum, you can change its attributes, properties, etc.. A child is merely a set of modifications, unlike react's element which depicts a full state of UI.

With our knowledge so far, one way to update the UI is just mutate `this.data`.

Consider this ticking clock example:

```js
class MyApp extends MixinD3 {
  connectedCallback() {
    super.connectedCallback();
    this.data = [
      { tag: "h1", text: "Hello, world!" },
      { tag: "h2", key: (d) => d },
    ];

    setInterval(() => {
      this.data[1].children = ["It is ", new Date().toLocaleTimeString(), "."];
    }, 1000);
  }
}
```

**[Try it on CodePen](https://codepen.io/vegertar/pen/KKQYRyW)**

It sets `this.data[1].text` every second from a [`setInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) callback.

## Only Updates Whatâ€™s Necessary?

Short answer is can. Unlike react acts as a black box for DOM comparison, mixin_d3 derives d3 which maps data to node explicitly by either `index` or `key` to determine if to create/update/destroy a node. In last example we use the `key` function `(d) => d` to let d3 identify &lt;h2&gt;'s children by data itself, i.e. `"It is " `, `` `${new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}` `` and `"."`.

You can verify by inspecting the [last example](https://codepen.io/vegertar/pen/KKQYRyW) with the browser tools:

![Only Updates Whatâ€™s Necessary](media/Only-Updates-Whats-Necessary.gif)

Even though we reset the children array describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents have changed gets updated by the way [how d3 works with a `key`](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/#key). If you remove it, you will see nothing changed after the first rendering for such children.
